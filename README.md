Welcome to the official GitHub repository of the dynamic, injectable, scripting language **VenusScript**.
See the [examples directory](https://github.com/levkoposc/VenusScript/tree/master/examples) to get a closer look in how the language works.
Based on [VenusScript](https://github.com/BloodShura/VenusScript)
